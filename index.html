                    <p>
                        I'm so excited about my new career path and the ability to pursue my passion for helping people
                        in a
                        new
                        way! In the past I have tried different ways to make a living, but nothing has satisfied my
                        hunger
                        for
                        "bigger and better me" completely. I always felt like something was missing, always thirsty for
                        more...!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then a good friend of mine kept telling me about web-development and how much he enjoys it. I
                        was
                        curious,
                        but so <strong>far</strong> away from being "techy". And everytime he tried to talk me into it,
                        I
                        was
                        too
                        scared to make that leap into the unknown, it's like falling out of the airplane without a
                        parachute
                        or
                        driving in the car at 120mph down a steep mountain road. Well you can only imagine what it's
                        like!
                    </p>

                        But I finally did it, and look at me and my awesome Portfolio. Look at all of the cool staff
                        that I
                        know
                        now:

                            <li>HTML5</li>

                        </ul>
